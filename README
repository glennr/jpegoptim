Jpegoptim v1.2.3  Copyright (c)  Timo Kokkonen, 1996,2002,2009.


REQUIREMENTS
	Independent JPEG Group's jpeg library version 6a or later
	(jpegsrc.v6a.tar.gz)

TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux
	Solaris
	Darwin/OSX (compiles fine as 64bit app on Snow Leopard)

INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, make nesessary changes to the Makefile,  and then
        compile the program. You may wanna do something like this:

		zcat jpegoptim-1.2.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd jpegoptim-1.2.3
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install

USAGE

  Basic Usage;
    $ jpegoptim -p -o -dest=./compressed --strip-all -m90

  To do a recursive find of all jpg files & optimize to 60%, preserving original timestamps, overwriting original files;
    $ find . -iname *.jpg -exec jpegoptim -p -m60 --strip-all {} \;

HISTORY
  v1.2.4 - Improved error messaging for rename() calls by Glenn Roberts (Jun 2010)
    minor code clean up.
	v1.2.3 - IPTC marker support by Dustin Ward,
		 ICC profile support by Dwight Kelly,
		 minor fixes
	v1.2.2 - Now Exif and COM markers are not discarded
                 (all other markers are discarded as before).
	         New options --strip-all, --strip-exif, and --strip-com
	         added for controlling what markers to strip.
	v1.2.1 - fixed buggy temp file handling
	v1.2.0 - Added new options --overwrite and --preserve.
		 GNU autoconf support added, also.
	v1.1   - new -f option, and other minor changes, improved
	 	 support for other platforms
	v1.0a  - some changes in docs & makefile
	v1.0   - first public release

TROUBLESHOOTING
  On OSX 10.5.x you might get an "Operation not permitted" error if your JPEGs are on a mounted volume. i.e.;
    renaming: jpegoptim-0-4778.tmp to blah123.JPG
    Rename error: Operation not permitted
    jpegoptim: cannot rename temp file.

  This might fixed with;
    $ chflags -R nouchg .
